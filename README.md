The gymnasium repository is a place for practicing algorithms!
As of 12/01/2023 I began to trek through the following algorithm types: 
1. Frequency Count
2. Array and String
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Decrease and Conquer, which includes binary search
6. Dynamic Programming
7. Recursion
8. Linked List
9. Graph
10. Binary Tree
11. Binary Search Tree
12. Hash Table
13. Matrix
14. Moving Window, which includes two-pointer functions
15. Trie
16. Binary Heap
17. Sorting Algorithms
18. System Design
19. Math and Logic
20. Interval
21. Backtracking

By comparison, the algorithm techniques discussed by Hash Goel, a former software engineer at Google and Pinteret who received offers from Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, and Microsoft are enumerated here:

1. Array and String
2. Binary Search
3. Recursion
4. Backtracking
5. Linked List
6. Stack 
7. Queue
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Binary Tree
10. Binary Search Tree
11. Hash Table
12. Hash Functions
13. Graph
14. Heap
15. Sorting Algorithms
16. Bit Manipulation
17. Selection Algorithm
18. Trie 
19. Approaching Problems
20. Execution in Memory
21. Common Myths

My journey was stored on Google Sheets here: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15zHGNvYy0-NMx6YYduk3UVvPFTXsam7YO1OQzeq2c7s/edit?usp=sharing

On the Google Sheet I kept track of:

1. Functions
2. Function types
3. Sub-types and patterns 
4. Expected difficulty
5. "Cracking the Coding Interview" question number
6. URL to the Leetcode, Outco, or Geeks to Geeks problem description
7. The date a function was successfully tested
8. The number of days which have transpired since I last practiced the algorithm
9. The number of times the algorithm has been practiced overall
10. The time and space complexity of the algorithm
11. Detailed notes stating how the algorithm solution works. 
12. Additional functions to see.
