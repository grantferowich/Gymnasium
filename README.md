The gymnasium repository is a place for practicing algorithms!
As of 12/01/2023 I began to trek through the following algorithm types: 
1. Frequency Count
2. Array and String
3. Decrease and Conquer
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Recursion
6. Linked List
7. Graph and Tree
8. Hash Table
9. Matrix
10. Moving Window
11. Trie
12. Heap
13. Sort
    
My journey was stored on Google Sheets here: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15zHGNvYy0-NMx6YYduk3UVvPFTXsam7YO1OQzeq2c7s/edit?usp=sharing

On the Google Sheet I kept track of:

1. Functions
2. Function types
3. Sub-types and patterns 
4. Expected difficulty
5. "Cracking the Coding Interview" question number
6. URL to the Leetcode, Outco, or Geeks to Geeks problem description
7. The date a function was successfully tested
8. The number of days which have transpired since I last practiced the algorithm
9. The number of times the algorithm has been practiced overall
10. The time and space complexity of the algorithm
11. Detailed notes stating how the algorithm solution works. 
12. Additional functions to see.
