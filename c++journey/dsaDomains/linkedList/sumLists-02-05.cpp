 * Chapter 2, question 5: Sum Lists
 * * *
 * input1 
 * integer1  = { 7, 1, 6 } OR 617
 * integer2 = { 5, 9, 2 } OR 295
 * Output1 = { 2, 1, 9} OR 912
 
 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list,
 * where each node contains a single digit. The digits are
 * are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit
 * is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds
 * the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. 
 * (You are not allowed to "cheat" and just convert the linked
 * list to an integer.)
 * Input: Linked list
 * Output: Linked list
 * Constraints: 
 * Edge: 
 * Time complexity: O(k) where k is the number of nodes in the 
 * longest linked list of the input linked lists.
