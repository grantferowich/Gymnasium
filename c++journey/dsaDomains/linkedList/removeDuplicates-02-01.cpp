 * Developed Sunday October 1, 2023.
 * Chapter 2, question 1: Remove Duplicates

 * Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

 * For example, 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 becomes 3 - 2 - 1. 

 * The approach here is to make a hash map of integers and integers to determine the frequency of each key.
 * Delete the keys when the frequency is above one. When deleting a node, decrement the frequency value in the 
 * frequency map. 

 * The function takes in the head of the linked list.
