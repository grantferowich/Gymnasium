 * Chapter 1, question 9: String Rotation
 * Assume you have a method isSubstring which
 * checks if one word is a substring of another.
 * Given two strings, str1 and str2, write
 * code to check if str2 is a rotation of str1 
 * using only one call to isSubstring.
 * E.g. "watterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat."
