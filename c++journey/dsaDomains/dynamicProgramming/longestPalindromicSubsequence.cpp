/* 
* Longest palindromic subsequence

* The solution considers base cases, and also, the solution moves right and left pointers closer to the center
* of the string at each recursive call. 

* Time complexity: O(N^2)
* Space complexity: O(N^2)
* Input:  "vtvvv"
* Output: 4

* Longest palindromic subsequence here is "vvvv"


* Input:  "pwnnb"
* Output: 2

* Longest palindromic subsequence here is "nn"


* Input:  "ttbtctcbt"
* Output: 7

* Longest palindromic subsequence here is "tbtctbt"

* input: 'hannah'
* output: 6
* input: string
* output: number

* input: "g"
* output: 1
* number is a thing being maximized
