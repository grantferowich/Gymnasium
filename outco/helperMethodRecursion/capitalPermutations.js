/**
 * 
 * Capital Permutations
 * 
 * Given a string str of lowercase alphabetical characters, return the set of all permutations of those characters in upper AND lowercase.
 * Advanced
 * Solve the same problem, except now you may have number characters in your string (which don't have a lowercase or uppercase, but should still be included in your result) and capital letters, that need to be lowercased.
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: ["ABC", "ABc", "AbC", "aBC", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "abc"]
 * 
 * Advanced:
 * Input: "A1d3"
 * Output: ["A1D3", "a1D3", "A1d3", "a1d3"]
 * 
 * Time Constraints: O(2^N) (exponential)
 * Space Constraints: O(2^N) 
 *
