/**
 * The tower of hanoi problem gives a number and expects

 * Input: 2
 * Output: Disk 1 moved from A to B
 * Disk 2 moved from A to C
 * Disk 1 moved from B to C
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: Disk 1 moved from A to C
 * Disk 2 moved from A to B
 * Disk 1 moved from C to B
 * Disk 3 moved from A to C
 * Disk 1 moved from B to A
 * Disk 2 moved from B to C
 * Disk 1 moved from A to C
