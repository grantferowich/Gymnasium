// given a node in a binary search tree
// return true if the tree is a binary search treee

// a binary search tree is a tree in
// which all the child nodes in the left subtree have smaller values than the parent nodes
// and one in which child nodes in the right subtree are greater than their parent nodes

// recurse from the base case at depth 0 until the end of the tree

// check left and right 

// if all child nodes to the right are greater than their parent node 
// and
// if all child nodes to the left are less than their parent node
// then the tree is a valid binary search tree

// a binary tree is a tree where every node has 2 children
