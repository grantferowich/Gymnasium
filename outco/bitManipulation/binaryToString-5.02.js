Binary to String

CTCI 5.02

input: a number between 0 and 1 
output: a binary representation of the number 

Every decimal between 0 and 1 may be represented as
the binary representation of the number * 100, 
which produces the numerator of the final result.
The denominator of the final result is given by the binary
representation of 100, which is 1100100.

Input: 0.16
