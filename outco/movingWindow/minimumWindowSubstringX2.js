 * Minimum Window Substring (Sliding Window)
 *
 * Wrote down: May 9, 2023
 * 
 * Given a string, and a set of characters
 * return the substring representing the SMALLEST
 * window containing those characters.
 *
 * The characters needn't appear in the order in which they are given.
 *
 * If not all the characters are present in the string, return the empty string.
 *
 *
 * Input: str   (String)
 *        chars (String)
 *
 * Output: {String}
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *  Input: "ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC"
 *  Output: "BANC"
 *
 *  Input: "HELLO WORLD", "FOO"
 *  Output: ""
 *
 *
 * Explanation:
 *   Though there are many substrings containing all the characters
 *   "BANC" is the shortest.
 *
 * Assume that there won't be repeated characters in the second string input.
 *
 * Ignore capitalization.
 * (though taking it into account doesn't change the solution much)
 *
 * But as extra credit, how would you handle repeats?
 * Meaning if you were given two "A" characters, a valid window MUST
 * contain two "A"s
 *
 *
 * Initialize two pointers called leftPtrInt and rightPtrInt.
 * Initialize a map called charMap.
 * Expand the window by incrementing the rightPtrInt.
