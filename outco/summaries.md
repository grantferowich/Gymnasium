'The removeVertex(id) is a member function of a Graph class that takes a single argument, id. This function does the following steps: It checks if the vertex already exists in the storage using the given id. If it does not exist, it returns false. If it exists it loops through the storage, and for each vertex, it retrieves the edges in the storage and check if the id passed as parameter is present in the edges. If it is present it removes that edge using splice method, which removes the edge at a given index. Lastly it deletes the vertex using the delete operator and returns true. This function is removing a vertex and all the edges that are connected to it on the graph.'

'The addEdge(id1, id2) is a member function of a Graph class that takes two arguments, id1 and id2. It does the following: It creates an empty array called vertexList. Iterates through the storage object and adds each vertex to the vertexList array. It checks if id1 and id2 exist in the vertexList array. If either one of them doesnt exist, it returns false. It adds the edge between id1 and id2 to the storage object and returns true. This function is adding an edge between two vertices in a Graph, It checks first if both id1 and id2 exist in the graph and if they exist it creates an edge between them.'

The removeEdge(id1, id2) is a member function of a Graph class that takes two arguments, id1 and id2. It does the following: It checks if id1 exists in the storage object, if it does not exist it return false. If it exists it retrieves the edges for the vertex, and checks if id2 is present as an edge. If it is present it removes that edge using the splice method, which removes the edge at a given index, then return true. If id1 doesn't exist in the storage object, it returns false. This function removes the edge between vertex id1 and id2, it checks if both vertices exist in the graph, if they exist it removes the edge between them.

The isVertex(id) is a member function of a Graph class that takes one argument id. It checks if a vertex exists in the storage object using the passed id, if it does exist it returns true, if not it returns false. This function is checking if a certain vertex is present in the graph or not by checking if it exists in the storage or not.

The neighbors(id) is a member function of a Graph class that takes one argument id.
It does the following: It checks if the vertex exists in the storage object, if it does not exist it returns null
If it exists, it returns the edges (neighbors) for the vertex, by accessing the edges array from the storage object.
This function is used to retrieve the neighbors of a certain vertex, it does that by taking the id of the vertex and checking if it exists in the storage, then it returns all the edges for that vertex, if the vertex does not exist it returns null.
It's not modifying the graph storage, only just returning the neighbors for a certain vertex.


The graphIsATree is a function that takes one argument graph which is supposed to be a graph. The function is checking if the given graph is a tree. It does the following: It checks for any islands by iterating through the graph object and for each vertex it checks if there's any edges, if there's none it returns false. It sets the root node as the first element in the graph object. Initializes a queue and a visited object. It performs a breadth-first search starting on the root node. For each node, it adds its edges to the queue and marks the node as visited in the visited object. If the loop ends and all the nodes have been visited it returns true, otherwise it returns false. This function is determining whether the input graph is a tree or not, it does that by checking if any vertices are disconnected from the graph and by checking if the graph is connected and doesn't have any cycles, if so, then it's a tree, otherwise it's not.

The method, named "removeFromTail", removes the last node (also known as the "tail") of the linked list, and returns the removed node.It first checks if the linked list is already empty and returns nothing in this case. If the length is 1, it remove the only head, tail and decrease the length of list by 1. If the length is greater than 1, it iterates through the list to find the second-to-last node, updates the tail reference to point to this node, and then sets the next reference of this node to null, thus removing the last node from the list. Lastly, it decrease the length of list by 1. The method will return the removed node in all of these cases.


This function takes in a node and an integer n as its parameters. It performs the following steps: It creates a dummy node called dummy, which serves as a placeholder and it sets its next property to the input node. It initializes a variable length to 0, and another variable current to the input node. It enters a while loop that iterates as long as current is truthy, and in each iteration it increments length and sets current to the next property of the current current node. The while loop ends when current becomes falsy, which means all the next properties of the node is null, thus has been reached the end of linked list. if length is 1, the function sets the next property of dummy to null. it sets current to the input node again and calculates target as length - n. The function then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to target and in each iteration, it checks if x is equal to target - 1. If it is, it sets the next property of the current current's next property to the next property of the current current's next property. Regardless of the if statement it sets current to the current's next property. Finally the function returns dummy.next which is the input node with the nth node from the end of the linked list removed. This function is removing the nth node from the end of a singly linked list, it does so by first calculating the length of the linked list using a while loop, then using another loop to iterate over the list and stopping at the node that is n nodes away from the end.

This function takes in two parameters, list1 and list2, which are assumed to be singly linked lists that are already sorted in ascending order. It performs the following steps: It creates a dummy node called dummy and initializes a variable called tail to this node. It enters a while loop that iterates as long as both list1 and list2 are truthy. In each iteration, it compares the value of the list1 and list2 head, if the value of the list1 is less than or equal to the value of list2 it sets the next property of the tail node to the list1 head and move list1 head to its next node, otherwise it sets the next property of the tail node to the list2 head and move list2 head to its next node. It updates the tail node with the current tail's next property. If the first list is empty and the second is not, it sets the tail's next property to list2.If the second list is empty and the first is not, it sets the tail's next property to list1. Finally, the function returns the dummy.next which is the merged and sorted linked list. This function is merging two already sorted linked lists into a new sorted linked list. It does so by iterating over both linked lists and comparing their current nodes values and appending the smaller of the two to the result. It makes use of dummy head and tail pointers to keep track of the merging. It's a simple O(n) solution where n is the total number of nodes in both lists.


This function is an implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem using an arrow function and a helper function. The helper function moveDiscs takes four parameters: num, source, auxiliary, and target and it's responsible for the recursion process. The main function towerOfHanoi takes the same parameters as the helper function and it's calling the helper function passing the parameters, and it's returning the result of calling the helper function. The logic of the function is the same as the previous implementation, where the base case is when num equals to 0, in this case, there are no disks to move, otherwise, the function first moves num - 1 disks from source to auxiliary peg using recursion, then it moves the numth disk from source to target peg, and finally, it moves the num - 1 disks from auxiliary to target peg using recursion again. The function will work as expected and will output the expected result.

This is a class definition for a SkipListNode, which has properties "key", "value", and "forward", which is an array. In the constructor, it sets the key and value to either the provided value or null if no value is provided. It also creates an array of "level + 1" length, filled with null values, and assigns it to the "forward" property.

This function adds a new node to a skip list data structure. It starts by initializing an array called 'update' with the same length as the current level of the skip list and all its elements set to null. Then it creates a variable called "current" that points to the head of the skip list. The function loops through all the levels of the skip list, starting from the highest level, and for each level, it loops through all the nodes in that level and keeps moving forward until it finds a node with a key that is greater than or equal to the key being inserted. At each iteration of the inner loop, it assigns the current node to the corresponding position in the 'update' array. After the outer loop completes, the "current" variable now points to the node which has the key either equal or immediately greater than the key being inserted. The function then checks if the key of the current node matches the key being inserted, if it does, it updates the value of the current node with the new value and returns. If the key is not found, it generates a random level using the randomLevel function and if the random level generated is greater than the current level of the skip list, it updates the 'update' array with the head node for all the levels greater than the current level and updates the current level of the skip list with the new level. Finally, it creates a new node using the SkipListNode class, and for each level, it updates the forward pointer of the corresponding node in the 'update' array to point to the new node and the forward pointer of the new node to point to the next node.


This function takes a binary tree as an input and performs a Breadth-first Search (BFS) traversal on it, returning an array of the values of each node in the tree in the order they were visited. It starts by initializing an empty array called 'queue' and an empty array called 'result'. It pushes the root of the tree into the queue. If the root is null, the function returns an empty result array. It then enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. It takes the first element of the queue and assigns it to a variable called 'current'. It then pushes the value of the current node into the result array. If the current node has a left child, it pushes it into the queue. If the current node has a right child, it pushes it into the queue. This continues until all nodes in the tree have been visited, and their values have been added to the result array. The function returns the result array which contains the values of the nodes in the tree in the order they were visited using BFS.

This function takes an array as an input and deserializes it into a binary tree. It first checks if the input array is empty, if so it returns null. Otherwise, it instantiates a new TreeNode object with the value of the first element of the array as the root of the tree. It then creates a queue and pushes the root into it. It then enters a for loop that starts at index 1 and goes through the array in pairs. For each iteration, it takes the first element from the queue, which is the current node being processed. If the current element of the array is not null, it creates a new TreeNode with the current element's value, assigns it as the left child of the current node, and pushes it into the queue. Similarly, if the next element of the array is not null, it creates a new TreeNode with the next element's value, assigns it as the right child of the current node, and pushes it into the queue. This process continues until all elements of the array have been processed and a binary tree is constructed using the input array. The root of the tree is returned.
