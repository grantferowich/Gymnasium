Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

 

Example 1:
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]
]

Example 2:
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: 
[
[1,2,2],
[5]
] */
const combinationSumII = (arr, int) => {

}

/* Tests */
const arr1 = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5];
const int1 = 8;

const arr2 = [2,5,2,1,2];
const int2 = 5;

const resultMatrix1 = combinationSumII(arr1, int1);
const resultMatrix2 = combinationSumII(arr2, int2);
/* Test results */
