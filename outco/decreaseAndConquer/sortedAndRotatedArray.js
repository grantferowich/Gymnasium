/*
 * ## Sorted and Rotated Array [Extra Credit]
 * *Given an array with distinct values that is sorted and rotated, find out if a target value exists in the array.*
 * 
 * A sorted array is rotated by taking an unknown amount of values from the beginning and placing it at the end.
 *
 * `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` is rotated left by 2.
 * `[99, 14, 25, 78, 93]` is rotated to the right by 1.
 *
 * **Parameters**
 * Input: arr {Array}
 * Output: {Boolean}
 *
 * **Constraints**
 * Time: O(logN)
 * Space: O(1) /// this seems wrong since the array may grow, input complexity grows, total space complexity grows
 *
 * **Examples**
 * `[35, 46, 79, 102, 1, 14, 29, 31], 46 --> true`
 * `[35, 46, 79, 102, 1, 14, 29, 31], 47 --> false`
 * `[7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 9 --> true`
