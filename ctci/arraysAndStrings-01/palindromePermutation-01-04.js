Palindrome Permutation
CTCI 1.04

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation
of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is 
the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement 
of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limite to just
dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-character letters.
