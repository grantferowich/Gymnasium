Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming refers to a function that calls another sub-function in order to produce a desired outcome. A function will be called recursively until a specific condition is met. The purpose of the function called by the primary function is to solve a sub-problem. The idea of dynamic programming is to solve sub-problems as a mechanism for solving a problem. 

The canonical example of dynamic programming is the nth fibonacci function. To solve for the nth term in the fibonacci sequence a function combines the (n-1) and (n-2) terms. The function recursively calls the sub-function until n is 2.
